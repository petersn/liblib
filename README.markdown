liblibrary
==========

**liblibrary** is a library for interfacing various libraries regardless of language.

The primary functions:

* To allow arbitrary functions to call each other between languages.
* To define abstract data types that are common to many languages.

----------------

Languages that can currently import liblib:

* C
* Python

Languages that you can currently call using liblib:

* C

Note that currently this just makes for a rather pointless interface to use
a C library to call C from Python. Or worse, call C using a C library from C.
Just you wait, it'll get awesome.

Languages on the support wishlist:

* C
* Python
* Mathematica
